## User Onboarding

### start-onboarding

Initialize conversation with bot to enable personal messages.

**Actor:** Any user
**Chat:** Private (DM with bot)

**Trigger:**
- User clicks deep link from fallback-notification
- User manually sends /start to bot
- First-time interaction with bot

**Related:** `fallback-notification`, `event-payment-notifications`

**Flow:**
1. User sends `/start` command to bot (in private chat)
2. Bot sends welcome message
3. Conversation initialized → bot can now send personal notifications to this user
4. Future payment notifications will be delivered successfully

**Welcome message:**
```
👋 Welcome to Squash Payment Bot!

I can help you feel more comfortable in a question of managing squash sessions.

Currently unfinished businesses:
* Unfinalized sessions (one, two, three, etc.)    // `one`, etc. should be links to announcement messages of corresponding events.
* Unpaid sessions: cumulitively 10000 din. Type /my debt for details.

To see your history: /my history
```

**Purpose:**
- Telegram bots can't initiate conversations with users
- User must send first message to bot
- After /start, bot can send personal payment notifications
- Critical for payment-personal-notifications delivery

**Link to this feature:** Used in fallback-notification as deep link `https://t.me/{bot_username}?start`

## Interactive Input

### wizard-input

Interactive parameter collection for commands. When a command is called without required arguments, bot guides the user through a step-by-step wizard to collect missing parameters.

**Actor:** Any user
**Chat:** Private or Main

**Two modes:**
- All args provided → execute immediately (backward compatible)
- Args missing → wizard collects parameters one by one

**Step types:**
- `select` — inline keyboard with options (e.g., choose day of week, choose scaffold)
- `text` — free text input (e.g., enter time, enter number of courts)

**Wizard flows:**
- `/event create` → day (select) → time (text) → courts (text) → event created
- `/scaffold create` → day (select) → time (text) → courts (text) → scaffold created
- `/event update ev_1` → edit menu with instant and wizard-based field changes
- `/scaffold update sc_1` → edit menu with instant and wizard-based field changes

**Cancel:**
- User clicks [Cancel] button on any step → wizard cancelled, handler not called
- User sends `/cancel` during wizard → wizard cancelled
- Bot replies: "Cancelled."

**Validation:**
- Invalid input → bot shows error and re-prompts same step
- Example: courts = "abc" → "Must be a positive number", re-prompt

**Timeout:**
- Wizard abandoned after N minutes of inactivity → state cleared

**Testing:**
- Unit: WizardService (collect, handleInput, cancel, timeout), CommandService (orchestration), CommandRegistry, Wizard Renderer
- Integration: wizard flows tested in feature-specific files (e.g., `tests/integration/specs/scaffold-create.test.ts`)

## Non-functional requirements

### logging

Structured logging with JSON output and typed Telegram notifications.

**Logger (operational logs):**
- `logger.log(msg)` — info level, stdout
- `logger.warn(msg)` — warn level, stdout
- `logger.error(msg)` — error level, stderr + Telegram log chat

**Providers:**
- ConsoleProvider — JSON to stdout/stderr (`{"level":"info","ts":"...","msg":"..."}`)
- TelegramProvider — errors only, sent to log chat as safety net

**Event notifications (`transport.logEvent()`):**
- Typed events: `SystemEvent | BusinessEvent`
- SystemEvent: `bot_started`, `bot_stopped`, `unhandled_error`
- BusinessEvent: `event_created`, `event_announced`, `event_finalized`, `event_cancelled`, `event_restored`, `participant_joined`, `participant_left`, `court_added`, `court_removed`, `payment_received`, `payment_check_completed`, `scaffold_created`, `scaffold_toggled`, `scaffold_removed`
- Formatted by `formatLogEvent()` and sent to Telegram log chat

**Testing:**
- Unit: formatLogEvent formatter tests, ConsoleProvider JSON output tests, Logger routing tests
- Integration: verify `logEvent()` called with correct typed events for business operations
