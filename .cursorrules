## Language Guidelines

### Communication
- **Chat communication**: All conversations in chat should be conducted in **Russian**

### Code and Documentation

- **Documentation files**: All documentation files (README.md, architecture.md, etc.) must be written in **English**

## TypeScript Guidelines

### Type Safety
- **Avoid `as any`**: Do not use `as any` type assertions in TypeScript code unless absolutely necessary and there is no other way to solve the type issue
- When `as any` is unavoidable, add a comment explaining why it's necessary and what alternatives were considered

### Import Paths
- **Use `~` alias**: Always use the `~` alias for imports instead of deep relative paths (e.g., `../../../`)
- Prefer `~/src/...` over relative paths like `../../..`
- Example: Use `import { something } from '~/src/utils/logger'` instead of `import { something } from '../../../utils/logger'`

## Summary
- Chat: Russian (русский)
- Code, comments, documentation: English
- TypeScript: Avoid `as any` unless absolutely necessary
- Imports: Use `~` alias instead of deep relative paths
